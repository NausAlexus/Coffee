                        <p>We only collect the finest coffee beans from the plantations. Our expert pickers carefully select only the ripe cherries, ensuring that only the best quality beans are used for our coffee. This process takes place during the harvest season, where laborers work diligently to gather the beans at their peak flavor.</p>

                        <h3>Roasting</h3>
                        <p>The beans are roasted to perfection to unlock their aroma. Each batch is monitored closely to achieve the ideal roast level, whether it's light, medium, or dark. This crucial step brings out the complex flavors and aromas inherent in every bean, providing a unique profile that defines our coffee.</p>

                        <p>The beans are ground to the desired consistency for brewing. The grind size is critical, as it influences the extraction process during brewing. Whether we're making espresso, pour-over, or French press, we take special care to adjust the grind to match the brewing method for optimal flavor extraction.</p>
